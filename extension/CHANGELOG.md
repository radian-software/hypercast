[keep a changelog]: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/

## 0.0.4

Report correct version number in extension instead of 1.0.0.

## 0.0.3 [yanked]

Use 0.0.4 instead. The manifest files were malformed in this release.

## 0.0.2

Add Firefox extension in addition to the Chrome version.

Unexpected errors are logged in the console properly instead of being
ignored.

## 0.0.1

Initial version. Barely functional. Is capable of connecting to the
official Hypercast server or a custom one. Supports public and private
servers, and lets you customize your session and client IDs (this
should be done automatically and not even be exposed to the user tbh).
Supports at least YouTube and Hulu, other websites not yet tested.
Extension requests permissions on those sites plus Netflix and HBO
Max. There is no way to have it not connect on every site, except
disabling the extension.
